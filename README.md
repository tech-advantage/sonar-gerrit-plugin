Gerrit Plugin for SonarQube™
============================

For every Jenkins build, this plugin reports SonarQube™ issues on your patchsets to your Gerrit server.  
SonarQube™ analyses full project, but only files included in patchset are commented on Gerrit.  
Plugin reports -1 or +1 for Code-Review (default) based on severity threshold (default:INFO).
